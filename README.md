# GoldenLine-App

Application allowing the analysis of certain statistical data of customers for a fictional company.



## Pour ex√©cuter en local l'application :

 - Download the code.
 - Install Python on your machine.
 - In your terminal, type the following command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (this command will allow you to retrieve the virtual environment that I created for the application).
 - Then, you will need to define a database. For this, I invite you to retrieve the randomly generated data in the DataAnalyse/dataset_generate folder.
 - Afterwards, feel free to use any database you want. You have the SQL data, you just need to create your superuser on Django admin and your users.
 - Don't forget to set the debug mode to True in the "settings.py" parameters of Django.
 - Also, don't forget to replace the information in DATABASES with your own database.
